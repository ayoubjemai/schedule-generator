# generate-schedule (TypeScript)

This project is a scheduling engine that uses a customized **Life-FET** (Fitness Evolutionary Timetabling) algorithm to generate conflict-free, constraint-based timetables for teachers, students, and educational activities. The application is written in **TypeScript** and supports a flexible and powerful configuration system to handle real-world school and university scheduling scenarios.

## âœ¨ Features

- Fully configurable time and space constraints for teachers, students, and rooms
- Written in modular, type-safe TypeScript
- Extensible and scalable logic for schools of various sizes
- Support for activity tagging, grouping, and advanced time-slot logic
- Configurable soft and hard constraints
- Pluggable fitness function for evolution-based optimization
